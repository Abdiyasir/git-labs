# Git rebase & squash
- Git rebase moves your commits on top of another branchâ€™s latest changes, keeping the project history clean and linear.
- Git squash works with rebase to combine multiple small commits into one, so you would have one clear commit representing your whole feature.


git checkout -b feature-rebase
echo "line 1" > changes.txt
git add changes.txt
git commit -m "feat: add first line"

echo "line 2" >> changes.txt
git add changes.txt
git commit -m "feat: add second line"

echo "line 3" >> changes.txt
git add changes.txt
git commit -m "feat: add third line"

git log --oneline    
git rebase -i HEAD~3
